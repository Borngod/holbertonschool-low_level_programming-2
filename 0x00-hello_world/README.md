## 0x00-hello_world

### Description

The first project out of many to learn and understand deeply how C programming works. Learning and applying C concepts to solidify understanding of the language.

### Project Takeaways

- Why C programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program

### Tasks

- Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
  - The output should be saved in the file c
  
- Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
  - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
    - Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o
    
- Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
  - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
     - Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s

- Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
  
- Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
  - Use the function puts
  - You are not allowed to use printf
  - Your program should end with the value 0
  
- Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
  - Use the function printf
  - You are not allowed to use the function puts
  - Your program should return 0
  - Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option
  
- Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
  - You should produce the exact same output as in the example
  - Warnings are allowed
  - Your program should return 0
  - You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux (Vagrant) to test the -m32 gcc option
  
- Write a blog post that explains all the steps of compilation. Use command lines and examples to illustrate.
  - Use gcc as the compiler

- Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
  - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
  - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
    - Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s
    
- Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
  - You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts
  - Your program should return 1
  - Your program should compile without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option
